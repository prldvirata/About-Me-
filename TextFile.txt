Patrice Virata Activity 2

Hi! I'm Patrice Virata. I'm currently a junior at University Of Nebraska-Omaha. I like playing video games, specifically MOBAs, MMOs, and RPG games. My other hobbies are painting and drawing. I'm currently interested in jewelry making because I work at a jewelry store at the moment. I have two cats their names are Tiger and Lynx.

My two cats!

Tiger

Tiger is a domestic medium-hair cat. I recently adopted her along with Lynx from Humane Society during winter break! She has a toirtoiseshell fur with fierce eyes. She's very friendly and she loves pets. She likes to nap, eat, and chill.

Lynx

Lynx is a domestic short-hair cat. She's a very playful cat that loves to run around and chase pipe cleaners. She likes to play hunt with her sister, Tiger. And she likes to look at all the critters outside.
