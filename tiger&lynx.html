        <p> Tiger is a domestic medium-hair cat. I recently adopted her
            along with Lynx from Humane Society during winter break! She 
            has a toirtoiseshell fur with fierce eyes. She's very friendly
            and she loves pets. She likes to nap, eat, and chill.

        <p>Lynx is a domestic short-hair cat. She's a very playful cat that
            loves to run around and chase pipe cleaners. She likes to play hunt
            with her sister, Tiger. And she likes to look at all the critters 
            outside.
